![Example image of the project](./images/weather_example.png?raw=true "Eaxmple image of the project")

Get the latest weather for any city. This weather dashboard allows you to search any city and will give you real time weather as well as a five day forecast. After each search the city will be listed if you need to go back to it and check it again. The saved cities will also persist after you even exit out the window.
